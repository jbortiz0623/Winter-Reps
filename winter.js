// How do we assign a value to a variable?
var variable1 = value

// How do we change the value of a variable?
var variable1 = newValue

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
var variable2 = variable1

// Remind me, what are 'declare', 'assign', and 'define'?
// Declare meaning is to give a variable a name
// Assign meaning is to give that variable a value
// Define would be a combination of declare and assign.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// pseudocoding explains a step by step process into planning, and its very useful becuase it helps figure out the approach and process.

// Create a variable called 'firstVariable'.
var firstVariable;
// Assign it the value of the string ''"Hello World"''
var firstVariable = 'Hello World';
// Change the value of this variable to some number.
firstVariable = 7;
// Store the value of 'firstVariable' in a new variable called `secondVariable`
var secondVariable = firstVariable
// Change the value of 'secondVariable' to any string.
secondVariable = "hello";
// What is the value of 'firstVariable'?
value of firstVariable is 7

// Create a variable called `yourName` and set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable `yourName` so that it returns a new string with them concatenated.

var yourName = "jay";
console.log("Hello, my name is " + yourName);



const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

console.log(a < b);
console.log(c > d);
console.log('Name' == 'Name');
console.log(true != false);
console.log(false == false == false == false == false == false == true);
console.log(false === false)
console.log(e === 'Kevin');
console.log(a + b == c);
console.log(a * a == d);
console.log(48 == '48');
