// How do we assign a value to a variable?
var variable1 = value

// How do we change the value of a variable?
var variable1 = newValue

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
var variable2 = variable1

// Remind me, what are 'declare', 'assign', and 'define'?
// Declare meaning is to give a variable a name
// Assign meaning is to give that variable a value
// Define would be a combination of declare and assign.

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// pseudocoding explains a step by step process into planning, and its very useful becuase it helps figure out the approach and process.
